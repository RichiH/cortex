# Cortex Security and Disclosure Information

As with any complex system, it is not possible to guarantee that there are no bugs. If you find a _security bug_ please report it privately to the maintainers listed in the MAINTAINERS of the relevant repository and CC cortex-team@googlegroups.com. We will fix the issue and coordinate a release date with you, acknowledging your effort and mentioning you by name if you want.

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the Cortex Team and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if itâ€™s already publicly known) to a few weeks. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days. The Cortex Team holds the final say when setting a disclosure date.
